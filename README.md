# prinTerra  
*Robotic 3D Printing for Sustainable Architecture*

PRINTTERA is an innovative architectural project that explores the integration of **robotics, additive manufacturing (3D printing), and sustainable construction** to revolutionize how we build in challenging environments. Developed at **Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)** under the guidance of **Dr. Morteza Rahbar**, this project presents a mobile Cartesian 3D printing robot capable of constructing entire villages using locally sourced earth-based materials.

## üîë Key Innovations & Objectives

### ü§ñ **Robotic Construction for Sustainability**
- **Custom Cartesian 3D Printer**: Adapts to uneven terrains, minimizing human labor while maximizing efficiency.  
- **On-Site Material Sourcing**: Uses local soil to reduce transportation emissions (0% imported soil).  
- **Multi-Material Printing**: Blends earth with recycled ceramics/plastics for structural resilience.  

### ‚ôªÔ∏è **Eco-Conscious Design & Workflow**
- **AI-Assisted Adjustments**: Real-time precision to reduce material waste.  
- **Modular Printing**: Cell-by-cell approach enables scalable, customizable housing.  
- **Biomimicry Cooling**: Cactus-inspired passive cooling for arid climates.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è **End-to-End Automated Workflow**
1. **Stage 1**: Site prep with LiDAR/satellite imaging + rammed earth stabilization.  
2. **Stage 2**: Robotic 3D printing with automated quality checks.  
3. **Stage 3**: Smart systems integration (solar panels, vertical farming).
